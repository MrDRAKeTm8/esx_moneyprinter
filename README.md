# ESX Money Printer

## Disclamer: 
** This is a work in progress version. **


This is a complete crime mod for use in ESX framework at FiveM writed in Lua under GNU V3 license, it is important to know you can modify, use and do want you want with this EXCEPT distribute it under a private version, do not matter if you modify it or not, if you do modify it, publish it or create a new branch here, created for the community, credits will be much appriciated.

### Concept and aim:
Gangs and Cops will fight over control on the money printer area, much like capture the flag a limit to the distance is been set;
this means the one who started printing will have to stay within distance of the money printer else it will fail to print.
the printer will print according to the options inside the config file.
some anti-cheating measures were taken to avoid abuse.

## To Do:

Building the printer itself. 

More maintenance interactions.
